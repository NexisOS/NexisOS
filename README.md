## ‚öôÔ∏è Example SELinux Module Structure

> **Note:**  
> This SELinux policy module is managed by the system and **must not be edited manually**.  
> Please make changes only via the package manager or official policy tools to maintain system integrity and security.

<details>
<summary>Click to see possible SELinux policy example</summary>

```text
policy_module(immutable_paths, 1.0)

# Define read-only types for critical dirs
type immutable_dir_t;
files_read_only(immutable_dir_t)

# Assign context to paths
files_type(immutable_dir_t, "/etc(/.*)?")
files_type(immutable_dir_t, "/usr(/.*)?")
files_type(immutable_dir_t, "/boot(/.*)?")

# Disallow writes to immutable_dir_t by normal users and processes
allow user_t immutable_dir_t:dir { getattr search open };
allow user_t immutable_dir_t:file { getattr open read };
# Deny write, create, unlink permissions explicitly
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Package Store Design

<details>
<summary>Click to see Goals</summary>

```text
Core Goals:

- **Desktop & Server (XFS + RocksDB)**
  - Filesystem: XFS with reflink=1 enabled for both desktop and server users  
  - Store: XFS with reflink-on-ingest (cheap deduplication)  
  - Hashing: BLAKE3 (fast parallel checksums)  
  - GC: staged deletes with Bloom filter acceleration (parallel workers)  
  - Metadata DB: RocksDB with WAL (handles large-scale, high-concurrency workloads)  

- **Desktop Only**
  - Uses ext4 on specific directories to optimize gaming performance:
  - /home (user home directories storing game data, saves, and configs)
  - /opt (optional, for commercial game installations)
  - Custom mount points for games such as /mnt/games or /data/games if configured
  - These ext4 mounts provide mature journaling, low latency for small file operations, and excellent compatibility with game launchers.

- **Common**
  - ACID transactions ensure data consistency
  - Refcounting provides precise garbage collection  
  - Backup of user home files handled externally (rsync/snapshots) ‚Äì no need to back up entire OS image  
```

</details>

## ‚öôÔ∏èOptimized Store Structure (Bucketed Hashed Store)

<details>
<summary>Click to see example tree</summary>

The store uses a **bucketed hashed directory layout** for fast lookups, deletions, and garbage collection.

```text
/store/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ab/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cd/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ abcd1234-vim/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ abcd5678-libpng/
```

</details>


## ‚öôÔ∏èDeduplication & Garbage Collection

<details>
<summary>Click to see features</summary>

```text
Deduplication:
- Content is hashed with BLAKE3 on write, ensuring identical files are stored only once.
- Filesystems with reflink support (XFS with reflink=1) enable cheap copy-on-write clones.
- No global store-wide sweep is necessary for cleanup, avoiding expensive full scans.

Garbage Collection:
- A high-performance database tracks reference counts for every stored path.
- GC workflow:
  1. Mark live roots (active generations, pinned profiles).
  2. Decrement refcounts of unreachable items.
  3. Move zero-refcount entries to `/store/.trash/` for safe deletion.
  4. Parallel background workers delete trash contents asynchronously.
- Advanced optimizations include:
  - Bucketed hashed directories for parallel GC without contention.
  - Parallel workers to utilize multi-core systems effectively.
  - Optional Linux io_uring batching to accelerate disk IO.
  - Bloom filters to minimize false-positive checks during reachability analysis.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏èRollbacks & Generation Management

<details>
<summary>Click to see features</summary>

```text
NixOS-like features:
- System generations stored as profiles.
- Each generation is a complete system specification.
- GRUB menu entries auto-generated for available generations.
- Atomic upgrades and rollbacks via symlink switching.

Generation Aging & Pruning:
- Older generations can accumulate, increasing storage and metadata overhead.
- Configurable retention policies automatically prune aged or unused generations.
- Generations marked for deletion have their references removed, triggering garbage collection.
- Efficient aging strategy:
  - Keep a configurable number of recent generations (e.g., last 10).
  - Optionally keep pinned or manually marked generations indefinitely.
  - Automatic cleanup runs as a background task to avoid impacting performance.
  - Parallel deletion of generation data using the bucketed hashed store structure.
- Aging policies maintain store performance by minimizing obsolete data.

Performance Highlights:
- **Store / Garbage Collection Cleanup:**
  - NixOS relies heavily on hard links and must recursively traverse the entire store tree to find unreferenced paths.
  - NexisOS avoids this by using a RocksDB-backed refcount database and a bucketed hashed directory structure.
    - Only unreferenced items are touched.
    - Parallel deletion of store entries across hashed buckets.
    - Optional io_uring batching improves disk throughput.
    - Bloom filters reduce unnecessary disk access during reachability analysis.
  - Should be significantly faster and more efficient on XFS with reflink support.

- **Database Performance:**
  - RocksDB is used exclusively for all metadata operations.
  - WAL support ensures durability.
  - Bloom filters accelerate lookups and GC marking.
  - Optimized for large-scale, high-concurrency environments.
